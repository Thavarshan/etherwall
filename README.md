# Forumbot

Forumbot is a single project which contains two applications; one a simple forum website with a functional website and database made using PHP and MySQL and the other an AI Neural Network with an API wrapper that performs Sentiment Analysis to identify and detect hateful and or offensive language. Both applications are simple implementations and are not robust solutions for real-world usage.

conda env create --file environment.yaml
```
